# Jira in a Nutshell

## 🚀 Understanding Agile
Agile is an iterative software development method that emphasizes flexibility, iterative progress, and quick adaptation to changes. 

### 🌟 Agile Methodology
- **Flexibility**: Agile promotes iterative progress, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes, enhancing product quality.
- **Roles in Scrum**: Key roles in Scrum include:
  - **Product Owner**: Talks to clients, creates backlogs, and defines the EPICs (e.g., "As a customer, I want to pay for my orders via online wallets").
  - **Scrum Master**: Ensures the team adheres to Scrum practices, and breaks down EPICs into stories (e.g., "As a customer, I want to pay using PayPal or Paytm").
  - **Scrum Team**: Handles tasks such as implementing wallet options and integrating payment APIs.

### 📅 Scrum Sprint Activities
- **Sprint Workflow**: Stories go through several stages: To-Do → In Progress → Testing → Done. 
- **Efficiency**: Sprints break down work into small, manageable tasks, leading to faster delivery.

## 📊 Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner**: Communicates with stakeholders and manages backlogs.
- **Scrum Master**: Coaches the team on Scrum best practices.
- **Development Team**: Completes tasks in iterative sprints.
